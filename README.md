## Code
OpenProducer is built on top of [Newspack](https://newspack.blog/), an advanced open-source publishing and revenue-generating platform for news organizations. Rather than starting from scratch, we are mixing in additional functionality for radio stations, podcasters, and other types of producers in music and media.
